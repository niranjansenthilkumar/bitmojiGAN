Backend code for Human Face to Bitmoji GAN generator.

This is a project where I want to create an application where I can generate Bitmojis using GANS from a selfie, and then create a portable machine learning model like coreml from this app that I can then port into an iPhone application.

Looking at what I need to do, I probably need to first train two datasets - one containing bitmojis and one containing  selfie faces at a certain angle, and train them using a jupyter notebook file. CycleGAN is a good one to use, i've seen it used on a bunch of different image to image conversions.

AdMob seems ot be a good move for advertising with the pictures, though i would like to use the same one that voodoo does wihch is ironsource, whatever gets people to download the games.

Future:
In the future, if this is successful I want to add other gan generators, maybe more cartoon stuff, and maybe like other photography stuff where people can change the weather in their photos, or even delve into photos and filters.

I think this could be good because tiktok could be like a flywheel where everytime we add a new filter -> it gets popular on tiktok and then downloads will come to us, which will then convert money if we do a subscription or ads or something.

And instead of instagram using the filters, I could get the ads or someshit on it.


steps:

1. do research
2. gather research materials and plan methodolgy
3. perform testing in notebook
4. refine
5. once i have model then export it into iphone application


future:
dancing 3d model shit that would be really cool, and they could sync with you also. im gonna look into that research paper.

masterplan:
build bitmoji thing, then arsenal of other gan applications, then use expertise/users to deploy 3d dancing thing.
