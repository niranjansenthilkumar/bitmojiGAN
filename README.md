Backend code for Human Face to Bitmoji GAN generator.

This is a project where I want to create an application where I can generate Bitmojis using GANS from a selfie, and then create a portable machine learning model like coreml from this app that I can then port into an iPhone application.

Looking at what I need to do, I probably need to first train two datasets - one containing bitmojis and one containing  selfie faces at a certain angle, and train them using a jupyter notebook file. CycleGAN is a good one to use, i've seen it used on a bunch of different image to image conversions.

AdMob seems ot be a good move for advertising with the pictures, though i would like to use the same one that voodoo does wihch is ironsource, whatever gets people to download the games
